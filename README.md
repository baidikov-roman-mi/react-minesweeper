# React with TypeScript + SWC + Vite + SCSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# It's a challenge

- Its my first project using TS, React and SCSS together, so that's perfect challenge, I think

# How to load it locally?

You may have vite project to load the project. Make sure you have the latest installed version of `node`, `pnpm` and `git bash` .

## Step 1:

Open git bash terminal and create vite project :

`pnpm run dev`

## Step 5:

Replace the files from the project to your folder and you can use the project locally and edit it as you wish
